**Task2**

1. Function building

   1. We try to develop a funtion to describe redundancy and information cost by the header. We use the same scale, vaild information loss, to measure redundancy and information cost. And then we translate the valid information loss into redundancy. The function is called v2.
      - ``maths about v2``
      - ``The meaning of v2``

   2. We discover that v2 can't fully reflect the loss, since the first travel through a edge are not counted as redundancy. Thus we make v1
      - ``maths about v1``
      - ``The meaning of v1``

2. Path enumerate

   1. We enumerate three paths. Then we proved that no possible better path then these three paths. Then we want to know which path is the best, so we calculated v1 and v2 of these path.

      - ``enumerate and prove``

      - ``calculate``
      - ``result and explanation``
